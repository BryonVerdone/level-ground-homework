          At Level Ground (LG), urban youth cultivate grit and resilience
          through Mixed Martial Arts. They learn to apply these values 'off the
          mat' in the pursuit of their ambitions through our Student Trainer
          Certification and College Access programs

        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>
          In addition to athletics, Level Ground provides college access and
          career opportunities to Boston youth. Our young people are exposed to
          a disproportionately high level of poverty and crime, and live in
          neighborhoods that experience a greater prevalence of obesity-related
          illnesses. From assistance with college applications to employment at
          our gym, access to our weekly nutrition workshops, and free athletic
          training, Level Ground strives to meet the needs of our youth in an
          authentic and compassionate manner.
